This repository contains code and supplementary material for the article
"Quantitative comparison of deep learning-based image reconstruction methods
for low-dose and sparse-angle CT applications".

Information on the environment setup can be found in the folder `supp_material/environment_details`.

Trained network parameters for the experiments on the Apple CT datasets are available from the [supplementing zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4460055). Parameters for the LoDoPaB-CT Dataset of those reconstructors implemented in [DIVαℓ](https://github.com/jleuschn/dival) can be found in the supplementary repository [supp.dival](https://github.com/jleuschn/supp.dival/tree/master/reference_params/lodopab).

Saved reconstructions are provided in two separate records:

* [LoDoPaB-CT Challenge Reconstructions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4459962)
* [Apple CT Test Reconstructions](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4459250).
