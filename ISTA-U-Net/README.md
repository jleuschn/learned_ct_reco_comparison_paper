## Description
Why have U-Nets been so successful in solving imaging inverse problems? In an effort to understand this, we show that one can reduce a U-Net to a tractable, well-understood sparsity-driven dictionary model while retaining its strong empirical performance. 

We achieve this by extracting a certain multiscale convolutional dictionary from the standard U-Net. This dictionary, visually illustrated below, imitates the structure of the U-Net in its convolution, scale-separation, and skip connection aspects, while doing away with the nonlinear parts. <br/><br/>

Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the reduced, task-driven dictionary model performs comparably to the classic U-Net! The table below showcases their performance (in PSNR) on two major CT and MRI benchmarks:

Beyond its strong empirical performance, the derived ISTA U-Net is favorably interpretable: It consists of two modules with well-understood, local objective functions, one implementing sparse coding and the other dictionary-based synthesis. 


## Installation
Code was tested on

* python 3.8.5
* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.6.0
* [dival](https://github.com/jleuschn/dival) 0.5.7
* [fastMRI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI) 0.1 


## Usage

We trained ISTA U-Net using python scripts in the folder `train_src`. Jupyter notebooks in the folder `notebooks` were used to evaluate and visualize model performance.
